# Conventional Commit Linter

The Conventional Commit Linter is a tool that helps enforce conventional commit message formats in your
Git repositories. [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) are a structured
way of writing commit messages, which helps in
automatic changelog generation, versioning, and semantic release.

## Installation

To install the Conventional Commit Linter, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install -g conventional-commit-linter
```

To run the linter (from a git repo):
```bash
conventional-commit-linter
```

Example output of valid commit format:
```
Evaluating commit "feat: add search button"
[OK] The last commit message follows the Conventional Commits style.
```

Example output with incorrect commit format:
```
Evaluating commit "Added search button"
[FAILED] The last commit message does not follow the Conventional Commits style.
 - Has inforrect type (prefix).
 - The first letter of the commit message should be lowercase.
```
